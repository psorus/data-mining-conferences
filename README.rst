Data Mining Conferences
=======================

----

**Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining** is an interdisciplinary area focusing
upon methodologies and applications for extracting useful knowledge from data [#ibmresearch]_.
Different from machine learning, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is
considered to be more practical and more related with real-world applications.
Some good examples include recommender systems, clustering, graph mining,
anomaly detection, and ensemble learning.

New version of https://github.com/yzhao062/data-mining-conferences
Lets see how long I keep this up;) Last update: 28.10.2022


To facilitate KDD related research, we create this repository with:

* **Upcoming data mining (DM) conference** submission date, notification date, and etc.
* **Historical conference acceptance rate**
* **Conference ranking** by `CORE (2018) <http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/>`_, `Qualis (2016) <https://www.capes.gov.br/images/documentos/Qualis_periodicos_2016/Qualis_conferencia_ccomp.pdf>`_, `CCF (2015) <https://www.ccf.org.cn/xspj/sjk/sjwj/nrjs/>`_, and ERA (2012)
* **Publication tips** from field experts

*\ ICDM has two tracks (regular paper track and short paper track), but the exact statistic is not released, e.g., the split between these two tracks.
See `ICDM Acceptance Rates <http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/ICDMAcceptanceRates.shtml>`_ for more information.

^\ All accepted WSDM papers are associated with an interactive poster presentation in addition to oral presentations.

Conference stats are visualized below for a straightforward comparison.
